First, I created a way to validate the date that the user is going to give me. In terms of the “relative days” variable, is because I am taking the Excel method to do sum and subtract operations between dates. 
I will create functions to ask how long until my birthday arrives in terms of days or months. Or how long until the next free day, using dictionaries to know when the special dates are.
