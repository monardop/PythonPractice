First, I created a way to validate the date that the user is going to give me. In terms of the “relative days” variable, is because I am taking the Excel method to do sum and subtract operations between dates. 
I will create functions to ask how long until my birthday arrives in terms of days.

## Person.py
This module will create a person. It uses my date module to use the birthday date to get the person’s age. Then, student and professor sub class will use this function to get the days before exams.
