# PythonPractice
This repository will be a bunch of practical projects that I designed for and by myself. The purpose is getting practice with Python and my logical skills with diverse types of projects.
The first one is a date-based project. With this one I want to put in practice the object-oriented programming, and learn basis of it on Python, like operator overloading and the basis of OOP, like inheritance and polymorphism. 
Then I will created a matrix project based in order to learn how to use NumPy.
